"""Apply pending SQL migrations from migrations/ directory.

Reads files matching `NNN_*.sql` (zero-padded number, underscore, anything,
.sql), applies any not yet recorded in the `schema_migrations` tracking
table, in numeric order. Each migration runs in a transaction by default;
add a magic comment on the file's first line to opt out:

    -- migration:notransaction

The runner takes a Postgres advisory lock at startup so concurrent invocations
serialize (the second invocation waits for the first to finish, then sees
all migrations applied and exits).

Designed to be invoked as a Railway pre-start command:

    python scripts/apply_migrations.py && uvicorn ...

The runner exits 0 on success (including "nothing to do") and non-zero on
any failure. If a migration fails, the API does NOT start — the failed
deploy makes the problem visible immediately.

Manual escape hatches:
  - To re-run a migration: DELETE FROM schema_migrations WHERE
    filename = 'NNN_xxx.sql', then redeploy.
  - To bootstrap a new tracker against an already-deployed schema:
    set BOOTSTRAP_MIGRATIONS=true on the next deploy. The runner will
    mark all migrations EXCEPT those in BOOTSTRAP_EXCLUDE as
    already-applied without running them. BOOTSTRAP_EXCLUDE is required
    whenever there is more than one migration: see _check_bootstrap.

Copied from api-kaianolevine-com (its ADR-0005), as deejaytools-api
ADR-008 decides, with two changes: there is no default exclude list, and
a bootstrap with no exclude list is refused. Production adopts
001_baseline.sql through bootstrap with every later file excluded.
